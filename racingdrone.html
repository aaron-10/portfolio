                    This is a racing drone I built using mostly off the shelf parts. It runs Betaflight on the flight controller,
                    which is quite common flight control software. It has a camera and a 
                    video transmitter, such that it can transmit a live video feed to FPV video goggles. 
                    This way you can fly the drone as if you're sitting in it. It has a top speed of more than 90km/h, quite scary...
