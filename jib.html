                    In high school I regularly helped out recording and streaming live stage events such as dance or
                    musical performances. I thought that there must be a
                    better way to record than holding the camera in your hand or having a boring stationary stream from
                    a tripod. I went looking around the school together with the rest of the camera crew and found an
                    old 4 meter long steel pipe, as well as a
                    massive tripod. We decided to turn this into a camera jib for getting much more interesting shots on
                    stage.

                    The tilt of the camera is passively maintained by a long thin tube that runs parallel to the main
                    arm. When the jib moves up or down, the parralellogram always keeps the camera upright. The yaw is
                    actively controlled by a motor. The arm is balanced using some dumbbell weights hanging
                    on the back.

                    The camera is attached to the jib via old internals of a moving head lamp. It contains a disc that
                    be rotated using a stepper motor via a belt, perfect for yawing a camera. The stepper motor is
                    connected to an
                    Arduino via a stepper driver. An IMU (gyroscope + accelerometer) constantly measures the rotation of
                    the jib and compensates
                    the yaw via various profiles. It is also possible to manually control the yaw using a joystick on
                    the handje of the jib.
                    The Arduino can connect to a smartphone via Bluetooth. This way it is possible to change the way the
                    yaw is compensated. By rotating the camera by a larger angle than the jib rotates, it is possible to
                    orbit a specific location on stage.
                    By rotating the camera by the same angle as the jib, the camera always points forward and it is
                    possible to move in a semi-straight line. It is even possible to do a very primitive dolly zoom this
                    way.

                    There is a screen at the user end of the jib that shows the live camera feed.
