                    This is the second battery that I worked on for Solar Boat Twente. It is a 14s NMC pack with a measured capacity of around 1400Wh.
                    It has a fused high power output for the motor, and lower power 60V and 12V outputs for powering the rest of the electronics in the boat.
                    The high power output and charge input are controlled by high current contactors that are controlled via the BMS. 
                     The BMS can communicate with the rest of the boat via CAN.

                    There extra safety features built in 
                    for responding to the emergency stop button and deadman switch. They immidiately disenangage the high power contactors, such that it is still possible to communicate
                    with the boat while ensuring that the motor and solar panels are shut off.
