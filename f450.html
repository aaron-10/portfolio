                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a drone built around an F450 frame. I used it for my high school final project, where I
                    worked
                    on designing, building and programming a flight controller. The frame, ESCs and motors are off the
                    shelf,
                    and I placed focus on designing the flight controller myself. The controller is based on an STM32
                    microcontroller,
                    which I placed
                    on a prototyping PCB together with an IMU (accelerometer and gyroscope) and a barometer.

                <h2>PCBs</h2>
                <p>
                    All the sensors and the transceiver are breakout PCBs,
                    and they took up quite a lot of space. As I wanted to fit the flight controller in a square box on
                    top of the
                    drone, I wanted to limit its size. This is why I decided to stack two PCBs on top of eachother. The
                    top one has the
                    STM32 with sensors to do all the controller calculations, and the PCB below it handles all the
                    communication with the ground station.

                <h2>Communication</h2>
                <p>
                    I could have used an off the shelf radio receiver, but that would be quite boring. So I decided to
                    use an NRF24L01 2.4GHz transceiver board,
                    such that I have full control over the data being sent in both directions. It allows me to send
                    custom
                    commands, as well as setup custom telemetry channels for debugging, which is not possible with most
                    existing 2.4GHz RC receivers.

                    I used this very primitive 'ground control station', which allows me to read out telemetry from the
                    flight controller in real time.
                    It has a standard radio receiver that connecs to my remote control, and it forwards the messages to
                    the drone. Of course this is a very
                    inefficient way of controlling the drone with the remote, but it gave me full control over the
                    communication channels which allowed me
                    to learn a lot more than doing it the 'boring' efficient way.

                <h2>Flying</h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote the software to read out all the sensors, handle the communication and run a PID controller.
                    After fine tuning the software for some time, and tuning the controller, it actually worked! Even though it flies a little bit (very)
                    wonky, it does stay in the air and its possible to control it using the remote.
