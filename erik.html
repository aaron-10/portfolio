                    This is the first battery that I worked on for Solar Boat Twente. It is a 16s LFP pack with a measured capacity of around 1300Wh.
                    
                    It has a fused high power output for the motor, and lower power 60V and 12V outputs for powering the rest of the electronics in the boat.
                    The output to the motor and charge input are controlled by high current contactors that are controlled via the BMS. The BMS can communicate with the rest of the boat via CAN.

                    It was quite tricky to fit the cells in the enclosure. In the end they were fitted in the housing by surrounding it with hard lasercut foam that perfectly fits the cells.
                    The cells are clamped down from above using a lasercut plate with foam in between, such that the cells are surrounded by foam on each side. This keeps the cells in place very securely.

                    The pack consists of two sections that are stacked on top of one another. In between the two halves there is a custom water cooling plate built from aluminium plates with an aluminium pipe in between. 
                    Thanks to the water cooling, the cells never exceeded 21Â°C, even in the scorching summer sun of Monaco during the world championship.
