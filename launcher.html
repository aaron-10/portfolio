                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a small launchpad to easily control things on a PC, such as hotkeys, launching programs, or
                    muting the
                    microphone. The buttons light up to indicate the function/state of each button by changing color or
                    blinking in
                    patterns. The function of the buttons can be changed between different profiles by swiping the side.

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>
                    The enclosure is recycled from an old LED power supply. The 3D printed buttons are each placed
                    in a small 3D printed frame. The frame and buttons contain little tabs that interlock
                    such that the buttons are firmly kept in place but can still be pressed smoothly.

                <h2>Buttons</h2>
                <p>
                    Each button has a small soft silicone button inside of it, as well as an addressable RGB LED to give
                    each button a different color.

                <h2>Touch sensors</h2>
                <p>
                    It has two touch sensors on the side, which allows it to sense a
                    ‘swiping’ motion along the side. This swipe can be used to switch button profiles, and is indicated
                    with some nice animations.

                <h2>Functionality</h2>
                <p>
                    The buttons can be linked to various functions on the PC, such as
                    muting/unmuting the microphone, launching programs, hotkeys, or basically anything else.
                    The way each button responds to a press can be changed in a config file. This includes setting the active/inactive color,
                    as well as setting the button type (press and hold, toggle or activate for certain time) and controlling if and how the button blinks.
